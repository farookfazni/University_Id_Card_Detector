# University_Id_Card_Detector
## Description
This is a Simple project that have been developed for extracting details from Uva Wellassa University Id Card. We created this for our third year Image Processing Project. In here if you provide a valid Id card then it extract the details and save it to file. **Note**: This Project is still under development. So if you like to contibute you can contribute to this project.
## Methodology 
In here first I have trained a model using Neural Network to detect the Id Card and the did some opencv methods to extract your photo in Id card. and used Teserect-ocr LSTM to extract the text in image.
## Future Work
1. We need to extract only the Name,ID,Faculty and Degree Part from the whole Image insted of extracting all the text
2. We need to add a only the id card (without background) then only it gives perfect result. So we need to find a way to solve it.
